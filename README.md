### Project Introduction
The aim of this project is to create an independent document-image processor using median filtering and
edge detection.
At base level the device will be able to take in an image input - formatted in arrays of the pixel colour
values by width x height (.bmp). The device will then process the image through appropriate algorithms
including median filtering and edge detection, and finally convert the image to a PDF file.

### Project Goals
- Starts up.
- Can interpret a bitmap.
- Can detect noise.
- Can filter irregularities due to noise using median filtering.
- Can determine edges of page from image.
- Can recognize text.
- Can generate a pdf of page image.
- Can successfully output PDF to computer.
- Accelerate processes using parallelization.
